This is a nostalgic page that most of us have adored since our childhood. With this app, you can now compete with your friends to see who is the best poke master.

### How to play

Click on the "Let's Go" to start. The timer will start and start guessing the pokemon name.

You can just use keyboard type and hit "enter" to go to the next pokemon. This speed up your game play.

You're free to stop at any time during the game play by clicking on the "End" button on the pokemon reveal screen.

Once you ended the game, you can decide whether to share your result as a comment or just simply ignore it.

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard is computed ONLY based on the number of correct pokemon guess, there are a total of 1000 pokemon. If you manage to hit that far, you're a true poke master.

In the event where there are more than 1 user have the same amount of correct guess, then the time to complete the number of guess is taken into consideration.
